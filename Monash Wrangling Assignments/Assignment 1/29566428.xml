<title> Genders, sexualities and religions in Southeast Asia</title>
<synopsis> This unit explores the intersections of genders, sexualities and religions within the political, social-cultural context of Southeast Asia. This focus is based on the premise that the impact of religions and by extension, ethnicities are significant to how genders and sexualities are understood and lived out in this region. Within the larger framework of Gender and Sexuality Studies, the privileging of contemporary debates, issues and concerns arising from this geographical region demonstrates realities that are situated and grounded. Within an inter-disciplinary framework, feminist and queer theories are critically applied to topics covered that include: pluralisms or fluidity of genders and sexualities in religion, narratives of becoming in the family, faith community and cyberspace, sexual citizenship in the national imaginary, construction of masculinities and femininities of those who inhabit border zones of being socially excluded/included, such as youth, migrants, sex workers and ascetics; and agency in revisiting the impasse of the universality versus cultural relativism of rights. The unit aims to enable students to reflexively engage with questions of identity, agency and praxis on the distinctiveness/'Asianness' of doing genders and sexualities in this region, and the value and limits of using an intersectional analysis on genders, sexualities and religions.</synopsis>

<title> Politics of crime</title>
<synopsis> The unit will engage students with to examine the factors that shape public policy outcomes and the consequences that result from policy choices in responding to crime and criminal justice. This unit examines the significant and lasting effects of the politics of law and order on different populations in our society. Students are tasked to consider a range of issues including popular and punitive approaches to crime, Indigenous politics, and the struggles of access to justice for individuals and groups from non-English speaking backgrounds and those experiencing socio-economic disadvantage. Students will be shown the politicisation of criminal justice and the process through which political leaders use criminal justice issues to enhance their own popularity, electability, or power. Students will unpack political considerations and their effect on crime through the lawmaking process as they influence laws and criminal justice responses that legislatures enact. Further we contrast the politicisation of crime in Australia with our international neighbours.</synopsis>

<title> Climate change: From science to society</title>
<synopsis> Climate change is a key global challenge for modern society. It will affect all natural and human systems and has far-reaching consequences for society. Responding to the effects of climate change will require international and interdisciplinary approaches. This unit provides the scientific background to climate change, and it assesses the environmental and societal impacts, and community and political responses to climate change. Starting from the basic principles and processes that define and govern the Earth's climate, the unit explores how the different spheres on Earth interact to produce the rich past and current variability of climate in space and time. It then highlights how human influences are shaping the future of the Earth's climate. Equipped with the essential scientific background, the unit will then investigate what options humankind has to respond to the economic, ethical and political challenges of climate change, including global and national governance models required to mitigate and adapt to its effects. The unit will provide students with the foundation and knowledge to respond to climate change challenges throughout their career, independent of their specific discipline.</synopsis>

<title> Non-adversarial justice</title>
<synopsis> This unit focuses on forms of problem-solving, dispute prevention and dispute resolution outside the adversarial system. It examines ways of lawyering that employ non-adversarial, psychologically beneficial and humanistic methods of solving legal problems, resolving legal disputes and preventing legal difficulties. Students will learn about a range of non-adversarial processes in both the civil and criminal justice systems and the theories behind them. A focus of student learning will be upon understanding when the use of such processes may be appropriate or inappropriate. The aim of teaching students this is to help them to understand the role that lawyers can play in preventing conflict and in providing non-adversarial means of conflict management or resolution. Students will be asked to reflect upon the role that lawyers can and do play in non-adversarial processes and upon the ethics of legal practice in such circumstances.</synopsis>

<title> Thermodynamics and heat transfer</title>
<synopsis> This unit provides the discipline basis for applications in energy, power and heat transfer. It is the core unit in the discipline of thermal sciences, providing a basic level of knowledge and problem solving capability in thermodynamics and heat transfer. The thermal sciences disciplines are central to mechanical and aerospace engineering, being used in the design and analysis of energy conversion devices and systems. Inevitably, in those conversion processes involving heat, analysis and consequent design requires an understanding of the basic heat transfer mechanisms. Thus, the unit is core to understanding aircraft propulsion and computational heat and fluid flow at later year levels.</synopsis>

<title> Concept art for design</title>
<synopsis> This unit extends students technical ability to conceive, refine and effectively communicate conceptual design work. Conceptual design work, also referred to as concept art, is an essential part of the industrial designer's repertoire in conceiving of objects which do not yet exist. This core skill has since the 1980s expanded to become a possible end in itself, with designers finding employment and careers in the design of conceptual objects never meant for manufacture, but instead for film, gaming, illustration, science fiction, and other multimedia fields. Centred on drawing, students will be taught a range of skills to capture conceptual designs by the visual description of three dimensional form, and communicate them, with a focus on the designs being plausible in detail but conceptual in nature.</synopsis>

<title> Art and social change</title>
<synopsis> This unit looks at key moments in history in which art and artists have actively strived to generate social change. With a particular focus on the late 20th and 21st centuries, Art and Social Change critically explores the dynamic sites in which art, life and activism intersect. Diverse contexts and artistic practices will be examined. Topics include the use of art in political propaganda, culture jamming, identity politics, indigenous art and politics, the environment, art and the impact of global terrorism, and critiques of the art world itself. These thematic weekly study topics will be complimented by discussions of theory from key writers and theorists in the field.</synopsis>

<synopsis> Physical chemistry provides insight into the fundamental reason that chemical systems and materials behave the way they do. This unit gives students an advanced understanding of the properties and characteristics of solids, liquids and gases from a fundamental level - utilising computation of individual atoms and bonds - right through to applied systems such as colloids and surfactants, relevant to minerals, food and formulation. The course follows a natural progression from atomic and molecular properties at a single atom or bond level through key thermodynamics to the properties of chemical systems, such as viscosity, phase behaviour and the interactions between solids and liquids. The final section deals with surfaces and colloids - key to understanding important chemical systems in Australian science and industry, due to their ubiquity in minerals processing, food and dairy industries, energy and oil, pharmaceuticals, water and waste processing.</synopsis>

<title> Film and television genres</title>
<synopsis> From their beginnings, films and television series have endlessly repeated the same stories. This unit explores the concept of genre, remaking  and adaptation in relation to a selection of contemporary and historical film and television texts. This unit describes genre as a complex situation that is enabled and limited by the related roles and practices of industry, critics and audiences. This understanding of genre is developed through three broad approaches to genre as: industrial category-deals with issues of production, including commerce and authorship; textual category, considers plots and structures; critical category, investigates issues of reception, audiences and institutions.</synopsis>

<title> The law of financial transactions</title>
<synopsis> This unit introduces students to the legal and regulatory issues relating to transactions undertaken by companies and other institutions in order to borrow money or otherwise to raise funds. The unit is in three parts.  In the first part, the basic building blocks of: the concepts of credit; how a company borrows money; and how it gives security to its lenders to secure payment, are all examined. The second part involves an examination of the various forms of borrowings, including syndicated financing and project finance. The third part deals with borrowing in the capital markets (that is, without involving a bank as a lender), both domestically in Australia and in other international markets. The unit deals with Australian law and also English and European law and US tax and regulation in so far as they affect Australian companies accessing the international markets. An understanding of common law contract law is assumed and some understanding of company law would be of benefit but is not required.</synopsis>

<title> Foundations of anatomy and physiology for health practice 2</title>
<synopsis> This unit is the second of the two units designed to familiarise health science students with the anatomical structures and physiological functions of the systems of the human body that underpin the regulatory mechanisms for homeostatic control. Students will be introduced to the structure and function of the cardiovascular, circulatory and respiratory systems together with their vital role in maintaining homeostasis. The key features of the lymphatic system and the properties of blood will be discussed. The unit will continue with a look at the importance of the endocrine system and its role in integrating various functions to control homeostasis. Students will be introduced to the key anatomical and physiological features of the urinary and digestive systems and the importance of maintaining pH and fluid balance within the body. Finally, students will be introduced to the reproductive systems, pregnancy and development. Throughout the unit, clinical connections will be made with the systems addressed so that students will understand the relevance of the topics included in the unit to the health and human science disciplines.</synopsis>

<title> The anthropology of international development</title>
<synopsis> The unit takes an anthropological approach to critiquing international aid and development and the global structures it is embedded within. Various theories of globalisation and the production of global inequalities will be explored. Anthropologists employ ethnographic research and methods to improve the understanding of development processes, and the notions of human progress it rests on. Through specific case studies of approaches, institutions, programs and practitioners across multiple cultural contexts an appreciation is built up of how development policy is imagined, produced, received or resisted and how those being developed, the so-called beneficiaries, are imagined, defined and assisted.</synopsis>

In this unit, students are encouraged to plan one or several acts of curation that need not involve works of art. Students may curate photographs, their hobbies, pieces of art writing, their own objects or those of others. However, the emphasis will be on the final form of the exhibition and the student's ability to explain and justify this curation. These exhibitions can take place in a variety of public spaces, including online. Classes will consist of 3 contact hours in which the lecturer will work with the students, and the students along with the lecturer will hold "crit" sessions in which proposed and upcoming exhibitions are discussed and workshopped.</synopsis>

<title> Leadership in social work and human services</title>
<synopsis> This unit will introduce students to an understanding of leadership in the human  services in Australia as a requirement for social work practice, one that is not always understood or accepted professionally. The human services sector is expanding in the numbers of its component organisations, both governmental and non-governmental, and in the size and complexity of the component parts. Leadership of social change and social justice in the human services is now at a premium, having been given little attention in the past or currently. Little is known of leadership requirements in this sector particularly as contrasted with other service sectors. Students undertaking this unit will be introduced to theories of leadership of humanservice organisations, their programs and policies, and leadership of the new organisational phenomena in this sector, large community service departments, non-governmental consortia, and advocacy organisations. They will also be introduced to other notions of leadership in social work - leadership through research, advocacy and community action.</synopsis>

Students will be introduced to different ways of thinking about social control in Australia and internationally. The unit introduces students to policing as a form of social control and students will examine the role of law, civil rights and culture in the context of police operations. Students examine the historical development of police services and their transformation since 9/11 along with emerging challenges associated with policing transnational threats. The focus then shifts to different forms of crime prevention that have gained popularity in recent decades as a means of addressing the shortcomings of criminal justice institutions in reducing the incidence and prevalence of crime. Students learn about different approaches including situational crime prevention and social crime prevention and consider the advantages and limitations of these in practice.</synopsis>

<title> Hearing the country: Studies in Indigenous Australian ethnoecology</title>
<synopsis> Australia is the site of a remarkable diversity of systems of knowledge. Indigenous knowledge systems and systems based on western scientific tradition have often been seen as the most distant poles on a continuum that ranges from myth to science. Continuing research in Australia shows that Indigenous ecological knowledge on this continent is detailed, localised and grounded in empirical observations. In addition, Indigenous knowledge is embedded within a system of ethics that is oriented toward long-term productivity. It is usual to contrast Indigenous knowledge with non-Indigenous systems of knowledge and care in order to show their divergence or even, in many instances, their oppositions.</synopsis>

<synopsis> Art Writing and Criticism is a unit in the "practical" dimension of the study of art history. Students will explore the various registers, genres and venues in which the discussion of art is carried out today - from academic journals, magazines, newspapers to online. Students will both gain a theoretical perspective on these different approaches to the discussion of art and their various histories and themselves undertake a number of practical exercises in writing in these different styles and formats. Students will especially be directed to thinking what is the future of the discussion of art in the new age of the internet and the electronic media. What opportunities can they think of for themselves and others to put the art-historical knowledge they otherwise gain in their studies to practical use in the public arena?</synopsis>

<title> Modern Islam</title>
<synopsis> The unit examines developments in Islamic thought in the last three centuries. In many cases, this era has seen the breakdown of the classical Islamic paradigms of governance, leadership, learning, and social order, and the consequent development of new Islamic or Islamist ideologies and movements. Examples will be considered from both Sunni and Shi'ite perspectives across diverse landscapes. The lives and works of significant figures in modern Islamic history will be studied in order to understand the diversity of the ways in which Islamic thought has responded to the colonial and post-colonial age. The course introduces the pre-colonial background of the Mughal, Ottoman, and Safavid Empires, before moving to the colonial encounters, state reforms and emerging ideologies in the nineteenth century. The course provides an up-to-date introduction to various Muslim movements in the colonial and post-colonial period. The course materials entail selections from important primary sources, as well as audio-visual materials.</synopsis>

<title> Programming paradigms</title>
<synopsis> Ability to code in differently constructed programming languages is analogous to speaking in different natural languages with varying grammars. Similar to natural languages, programming languages from different paradigms (styles) vary in their expressiveness and efficiency. One programming language may require many screens-full of complex code to accomplish a task for which another requires but a few expressive lines of code. Therefore, understanding the design principles of programming languages enables computational problems to be implemented in drastically different and powerful ways; leading, in some cases, to solutions that are more elegant, correct, maintainable, efficient and/or extensible.</synopsis>

<title> Popular culture in North and South Korea, Hallyu and East Asian cultural flows</title>
<synopsis> The unit critically examines the recent popularity of Korean popular culture in East Asia and beyond. The focus is on South Korean pop music, gaming culture and TV dramas. However, we will also be considering North and South Korean graphic novels and cinema. The course also situates the recent Hallyu (Korean Wave) phenomenon within the history of cultural flows in East Asia and we examine the processes that have contributed to the increased consumption of Korean cultural product inside and outside the Korean peninsula. One primary focus will be on the analysis of critical approaches to the understanding of North Korean state media and South Korean commercial cultural output. In particular, we analyse how state-centered promotion policies are tied up with notions of cultural nationalism. The aim is to move beyond fandom and to encourage students to situate the production of popular culture within the domestic and regional political, economic, commercial and industrial contexts and to critically analyse popular culture using a variety of methodological approaches. Each week students will be introduced to different methodological frameworks they can utilize to unpack popular culture. In their readings, they will also be exposed to a variety of approaches to the analysis of popular culture case studies.</synopsis>

<title> Life in the Soviet Union</title>
<synopsis> The unit will examine how Communism transformed everyday life in the Soviet Union by reshaping social structures and communal ties. How did the Bolshevik ascent to power reshape the private sphere? How did the Communist authorities try to create the New Soviet Man and Woman and forge a new, Soviet national identity? What relevance do these efforts have for understanding today's post-Cold War Eastern European politics? Through literature, films, memoir, and other primary sources, students will study and analyse the impact of politics on popular culture, work, family life, education, humour, and gender relations. Readings, lectures, and tutorial discussions will explore the degree to which individuals carved out private spaces at home, at work, and in social circles to limit the impact of politics on private life. The unit will begin with a background on Russian politics and culture before the establishment of Communist governments and will end with an examination of the USSR's collapse and its aftermath. Discussions of primary sources in tutorials will provide students with the skills to analyse similar primary sources in their written work.</synopsis>

<synopsis> Translational research is a growing and exciting new discipline in medicine that deals with the development of fundamental scientific findings into tangible clinical outcomes. Translational researchers are involved in identifying a worthwhile scientific finding that can be applied to a clinical setting. Along this research and development pipeline are a series of critical check-points that provide the investigator vital tools to generate a valuable result that has merit for translation. This unit will establish a fundamental knowledge in the processes involved in developing a basic science finding through to clinical studies. The unit provides workshop-based learning in the development of discipline-specific laboratory research questions and how they are applied to broader clinical applications. The main focus of this unit is to identify how fundamental scientific questions may have multidisciplinary clinical answers. Other core learning outcomes are through understanding how scientific concepts can be marketed and communicated effectively through research pipeline procedures and the responsibilities of the researcher that may be derived from this.</synopsis>

<title> Nutrition, activity and health in chronic diseases</title>
<synopsis> Diet and disease is an integrated study of the role of diet in the causation and treatment of chronic diseases that are endemic in westernised societies. This unit builds upon the scientific concept of disease aetiology explored in Integrated Science Systems (BND2103) and the critical interpretation of scientific literature and research skills developed in years 1 and 2. Learners will explore the epidemiology of the major nutrition related diseases, their causal pathways and population based recommendation for prevention. The rationale for the application of dietary modifications for patients with specific disease states and the means of evaluating dietary treatment is explored. Nutrition related emerging issues in disease aetiology and management are also explored and the emphasis on the important role of genetic susceptibility in nutrition science is continued.</synopsis>

<synopsis> This unit examines contemporary issues impacting on education for health care practitioners, within a context of continuous change. Students explore a range of theoretical underpinnings that impact upon the educational process in health care practice with emphasis placed on educational theorists. Students will apply theoretical learning to teaching practice through participation in practicum; or through their role as a teacher within their own clinical practices. This will include both classroom (small and large group) and clinical teaching experiences in a variety of settings. It will equip students with the knowledge and mastery of skills necessary to critique, understand and respond to the learning preferences and needs of those whose education they have responsibility for. It will prepare students with the skills and knowledge to critically evaluate and assess the outcomes of an educational intervention.

It focuses on a historical lineage of art's mediums and disciplines and how they are framed, constituted and judged in a diverse range of academic fields. Concepts and traditions of modern aesthetics, the effect of late-capitalism, socio-economic critiques of art and technology are pivotal to any understanding of how art's form moves between modes of medium-specificity to trans-disciplinary realms. The unit introduces key theoretical tenets to analyse late modernist and contemporary art practices as case studies.

What is the best way to construct, articulate and represent an argument? How do we distinguish real news from "fake" news? Should we believe what our doctors, mechanics, or financial advisors tell us, just because they are experts in their fields? By addressing questions like these, we will examine several methods of effective reasoning. We will also examine the ways in which reasoning can go wrong.

<title> Marketing theory</title>
<synopsis> Theory in marketing covers three broad levels; consumer, firm, and society. It also incorporates a number of different schools of thought developed over various eras. This unit is designed to give you an integrative introduction to marketing theory that spans these levels of analysis and streams of thought. The unit will also provide an introduction to the tools of constructing theory, and equip students with theory-building skills to conduct scholarly research that will legitimately advance the boundaries of marketing knowledge.</synopsis>

<title> Ethics and the modern world</title>
<synopsis> The unit adopts a global perspective but looks at issues through a South African and African lens. The theories of utilitarianism and deontology will be examined within the South African context and judged according to ethical dilemmas that arise within the country. Key to this examination will be a discussion of the role of friendship and family within ethical decision-making. A major focus of discussion is the opposition between consequentialist theories, such as utilitarianism, which judge rightness and wrongness solely in terms of consequences, and the Kantian theory of deontology which judges rightness and wrongness according to whether the act is in accordance with rational will. The question that will guide this discussion is whether these theories can account for the agent-centred reasons which arise from relations of love and friendship and which seem to have the potential to conflict with impartial moral requirements?</synopsis>

<title> Digital humanities in action</title>
<synopsis> Digital Humanities in action provides a distinctive, transdisciplinary opportunity for students to synthesise critical discourse with practice-based application in ways that are characteristic to the field of Digital Humanities (DH). Through active learning, students will be challenged to advance their practical, technical and conceptual skills developed in preceding DH (and other disciplinary) studies towards a complex multi-faceted design research project. The design studio will provide the framework for students to apply their critical understanding and creative skills to problem-based scenarios. The practice-based opportunities provided by the studio will be supplemented by complementary theoretical and design thinking content and methods. Students will be required to undertake a project that demonstrates suitable application of knowledge and techniques drawn from their identified stream of specialisation (in digital media, information and society, digital cultural heritage). Students will be expected to respond in a critical, ethical and reflective manner, while exercising creative, entrepreneurial and independent research skills. Critical discourse will be agile and responsive to contemporary issues arising at the socio-cultural interface of DH scholarship. The resulting project work will demonstrate both conceptual and technical application relevant to their knowledge domain (Arts, Information Technology, or Art Design and Architecture) to a high level of competence and literacy. The nature of the studio environment provides a unique opportunity for encouraging interdisciplinary approaches to practice and research. On occasion, these studies may be undertaken as part of an immersive research studio conducted as part of special projects and study abroad experiences.</synopsis>

<title> Data in society</title>
<synopsis> In the digital world, how we communicate, conduct business and socialize is revolutionising our way of life. The explosion of data and discovery are transforming the way we live and work, altering relationships between government and citizens, businesses and consumers, the researchers and the researched, the public and private sectors, the individual and society. This unit explores how big data analytics can potentially help grow the economy, improve health and education, support national security, protect the environment, enable more energy efficiency, drive innovation and progress, and support more resilient, sustainable communities and cultures. It also addresses the risks associated with the application of big data analytics in government and big business to support greater surveillance of citizen by state and consumers by business, disempower individuals and vulnerable communities, support discrimination, threaten social inclusion, social justice, human and civil rights, self-determination and privacy, and widen the divide between the data haves and have-nots.</synopsis>

<title> Research practices advanced</title>
<synopsis> Research Practices Advanced is a core unit in the Visual Arts sequence, and is the first of the two second year units. This unit is a practice driven, workshop based unit which develops a variety of methodologies and their contribution to a research practice in visual culture. It is designed to further develop, challenge and expand how students think about making artwork and to synthesise research interests, building on VPR1113. A series of individual and collaborative exercises and projects are presented to extend and further foster creative research skills and consolidate students' material skills. The main emphasis of this class is to demonstrate how thinking operates through making. Fabrication processes in the workshop can be in any medium from across two- and/or three-dimensional works, to sound and performance. The aim of these exercises is to further extend each student's capacity for production, creating a pool of ideas, strategies, forms and processes for students to draw on and develop as they progress through the course. Teaching methodology involves critical dialogue, classroom discussion and peer review. This unit presents a broad range of approaches to contemporary art and its institutions for those wishing to work in the arts industry as artists, curators, arts writers, educators or practitioners. Research Practices encourages an experimental approach to conceptual, material and public outcomes. Safe and sustainable approaches to fabrication and materials are core values in the unit.</synopsis>

<title> Nutrition, activity and health in chronic diseases</title>
<synopsis> Diet and disease is an integrated study of the role of diet in the causation and treatment of chronic diseases that are endemic in westernised societies. This unit builds upon the scientific concept of disease aetiology explored in Integrated Science Systems (BND2103) and the critical interpretation of scientific literature and research skills developed in years 1 and 2. Learners will explore the epidemiology of the major nutrition related diseases, their causal pathways and population based recommendation for prevention. The rationale for the application of dietary modifications for patients with specific disease states and the means of evaluating dietary treatment is explored. Nutrition related emerging issues in disease aetiology and management are also explored and the emphasis on the important role of genetic susceptibility in nutrition science is continued.</synopsis>

<synopsis> Slavery has existed since ancient times and has been used in societies as diverse as Ancient Rome and modern India, medieval Europe and nineteenth-century America. It still exists, in various forms, today. The unit investigates the meaning and experience of enslavement in a range of historical contexts. How and why have people been enslaved and what did it mean to live in slavery? How might slaves understand and achieve their freedom? Why have so many societies used slave labour? In recent times, attitudes to enslavement have changed, leading to campaigns against slavery in modern times: why did this happen, and to what extent have these campaigns been successful?</synopsis>

<synopsis> How does power operate in world politics? What is the relationship between power and knowledge about world politics? This unit introduces students to debates in the discipline of International Relations that focus on epistemological questions (or how we know what we know). Students will examine foundational, critical, post-structuralist, feminist and post-colonial approaches to knowledge and power within the discipline and explore their implications for key contemporary issues such as the rise of China and the legacies of colonialism. Contending theoretical perspectives offer different possibilities for interpreting politics and acting politically.

<title> The Minotaur to the Trojan war: Aegean archaeology</title>
<synopsis> In this unit we examine the art, architecture, burials and beliefs of two important pre-classical Aegean cultures, the Minoans of Crete and the Mycenaeans of mainland Greece. We study the labyrinthine palaces of the Minoans, the frescos and houses of the island culture of ancient Thera, and the rich burials and city states of Mycenaean Greece to discover what this material evidence reveals about social and economic organisation, ritual practice and thriving trade and exchange. Students are introduced to emerging techniques in archaeological research as we consider how these methods have influenced our interpretation of Minoan and Mycenaean culture. We explore the role of later Greek mythologies and epic poems, including Homer's Iliad, in shaping our interpretation of these Aegean societies and examine the reliability of their portrayal. Contemporary evidence from Egypt and the eastern Mediterranean is examined, to understand the wider world of the Minoans and Mycenaeans, alongside the study of the great city of Troy.</synopsis>

Content knowledge and specialist language are acquired that relate to the contexts of both fields. These skills are applied in class activities through practice interactions with police, lawyers, judiciary staff and other court-room interlocutors, and with doctors, general health and mental health specialists, and patients. This unit builds on the acquisition of dialogue interpreting and on the development and reinforcement of skills and techniques needed for consecutive interpreting. Further training in note-taking, including the use of digital pen technology, will be undertaken. Sight translation is introduced as a new skill at the beginning of this unit. In the second half of this unit, simultaneous interpreting is introduced. All four skills: dialogue, longer consecutive and simultaneous interpreting, and sight translation are used in simulated interactions. Interactional approaches to interpreting are presented as are theoretical concepts relating to health and legal interpreting as emerging research fields.</synopsis>

<title> Professional practice</title>
<synopsis> This is a core unit in the Visual Arts and is second of the two second year units. The unit provides students with a broad range of approaches to cultural production for those wishing to work in the visual arts industry across a diverse range of professional platforms. This unit introduces students to various professional processes and outcomes that contemporary visual artists engage and exhibit in. The workshop-driven classes incorporate theoretical and historical perspectives on these gallery-based modes. This unit introduces various steps required to make art public from: studio-based processes; the engagement of critical feedback; administrative processes associated with gallery-based exhibition; installing an artwork; and contextualising the artwork in a considered theoretical and curatorial framework. The workshop program facilitates a support structure for the development and consolidation of experimental approaches to conceptual and material outcomes of burgeoning research interests. Students are required to investigate and develop individual and collaborative solutions to a series of creative public outcomes. Teaching methodology involves lectures, fieldtrips, critical dialogue, class discussion and peer review. Safe and sustainable approaches to fabrication techniques and materials are promoted as core values in the unit.</synopsis>

<title> Competing models of political economy</title>
<synopsis> The defining feature of our age is the spread of capitalism to almost every corner of the globe. However, the victory of market economics has not removed the state from the realm of economic decision-making. Even the most market-oriented systems exist within political frameworks that enforce contracts, resolve disputes, regulate negative externalities, and provide public goods. Furthermore, capitalism remains intensely controversial. It has created unprecedented wealth and prosperity, but has also suffered from periodic crises, and critics argue that it has exacerbated inequality and damaged the natural environment. In this unit, Monash students learn how to evaluate these competing claims. Students will be introduced to competing models of political economy, learn about key thinkers in the history of economic thought, and gain insight into the intersection between markets and political power.</synopsis>

<title> e-Business software technologies</title>
<synopsis> Non-B2B e-Business applications are now mostly developed for Web and mobile platforms. With the advent of mobile Web apps a set of technologies and techniques has emerged that are shared by both Web and mobile application development. This unit introduces, explains and uses these technologies and techniques to build basic but industrial strength e-Business applications. The topics covered will be selected from the following: an overview of the current state-of-play in e-Business application development, HTML5 (the living standard), CSS3, object oriented JavaScript for large developments, JavaScript APIs, Ajax, JSON, XML and related W3C technologies, jQuery, jQuery Mobile, MVC, ASP.NET MVC, ECMAScript 2015 and beyond, Angular, TypeScript, React. The appropriateness of the selected technologies in different contexts, together with relevant best practice techniques for their use and integration will also be covered.</synopsis>

<synopsis> Examines the diversity of animals and organises them in a systematic way using their evolutionary history. We examine a range of representatives from different animal phyla, starting with the structurally simple and progressing to mammals, in the context of emerging and changing patterns in their body plans. These are related to changes in the ecology and diversification within the phyla. Concepts and theories developed during the theory part of the course are developed further in the practical classes. During these interactive sessions use of live material is made for observation and the characters used to group animals into higher taxonomic groups are demonstrated and discussed.</synopsis>

<title> Contemporary practices 6</title>
<synopsis> This unit is the last and culminating unit in the Contemporary Practices sequence. In this unit emphasis is placed on independent investigation, and the development of the creative and expressive potential inherent in students' work. Imagination combined with advanced conceptualisation and innovation in material manipulation should be manifest at this stage of students' practice. Students develop individual programs in conjunction with the lecturers that reflect their personal direction and evolving art practice. The program focuses on clear articulation of concepts. Lecturers facilitate students' own exploration, primarily through personal tuition where detailed analysis and discussion of students' work takes place. Whilst providing a stimulating and supportive environment this unit provides a bridge between students' experience in the supervised studio and a fully-fledged independent professional practice in the broader arts arena. The work produced culminates in an end of year exhibition of a professional standard, preparing students for entry into the professional world as fine artists in the discipline of choice, or the pursuit of further studies at a higher level.</synopsis>

<title> Conceptual illustration</title>
<synopsis> This unit will develop the students understanding of conceptual thinking in contemporary illustration. It will introduce them to new approaches to image making that do not rely on literal or obvious visual reference. The art of humour, wit, metaphor and abstraction will be utilised in the answering of each brief in order to strengthen the students' illustration and intellectual skills and consequently their confidence as strong conceptual visual communicators. They will be encouraged toward experimentation and exploration of both traditional and digital illustrative techniques.</synopsis>

<title> Business environment</title>
<synopsis> This unit introduces students to the environment in which organisations operate. From a macro perspective the unit provides an overview of the political, legal, social, economics and technological contexts in which business operates, the role of the states and its relationship to business and society. The unit also provides a brief look at the international environment in which business operates including cross cultural issues that may affect business operations. Continuing the understanding of the macro environment the unit considers the competitive and regulatory environment in which business operates and this is followed by a consideration of the changing global financial situation and its impact on markets and risk management. Along with the strategic economic and legal environment of business at the global, market and organisational levels, this unit will focus on the impact of new and emerging technology on business outcomes.</synopsis>
