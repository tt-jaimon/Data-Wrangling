This focus is based on the premise that the impact of religions and by extension, ethnicities are significant to how genders and sexualities are understood and lived out in this region. Within the larger framework of Gender and Sexuality Studies, the privileging of contemporary debates, issues and concerns arising from this geographical region demonstrates realities that are situated and grounded. Within an inter-disciplinary framework, feminist and queer theories are critically applied to topics covered that include: pluralisms or fluidity of genders and sexualities in religion, narratives of becoming in the family, faith community and cyberspace, sexual citizenship in the national imaginary, construction of masculinities and femininities of those who inhabit border zones of being socially excluded/included, such as youth, migrants, sex workers and ascetics; and agency in revisiting the impasse of the universality versus cultural relativism of rights. The unit aims to enable students to reflexively engage with questions of identity, agency and praxis on the distinctiveness/'Asianness' of doing genders and sexualities in this region, and the value and limits of using an intersectional analysis on genders, sexualities and religions.",

Students are tasked to consider a range of issues including popular and punitive approaches to crime, Indigenous politics, and the struggles of access to justice for individuals and groups from non-English speaking backgrounds and those experiencing socio-economic disadvantage. Students will be shown the politicisation of criminal justice and the process through which political leaders use criminal justice issues to enhance their own popularity, electability, or power. Students will unpack political considerations and their effect on crime through the lawmaking process as they influence laws and criminal justice responses that legislatures enact. Further we contrast the politicisation of crime in Australia with our international neighbours.",

Starting from the basic principles and processes that define and govern the Earth's climate, the unit explores how the different spheres on Earth interact to produce the rich past and current variability of climate in space and time. It then highlights how human influences are shaping the future of the Earth's climate. Equipped with the essential scientific background, the unit will then investigate what options humankind has to respond to the economic, ethical and political challenges of climate change, including global and national governance models required to mitigate and adapt to its effects. The unit will provide students with the foundation and knowledge to respond to climate change challenges throughout their career, independent of their specific discipline.",

Centred on drawing, students will be taught a range of skills to capture conceptual designs by the visual description of three dimensional form, and communicate them, with a focus on the designs being plausible in detail but conceptual in nature.",

The unit will help you understand how central governments of sovereign states relate to each other and to the global system in order to achieve various goals or objectives. The unit will achieve this by first providing a broad overview of the foundational international relations (IR) and theoretical approaches to foreign policy analysis. This includes studying various IR topics such as war, economics, intergovernmental organisations and diplomacy. Secondly, this unit examines historical and contemporary case studies of the foreign policies of major powers from Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle-East and North America, with an emphasis on American and South African foreign policy. Through these case studies, one will become familiar with the process of foreign policy making, grand strategies; and status quo and revisionist powers, amongst other topics.",

We will then examine how interactions within and between species and with the non-living environment generate the immense ecological variety seen on Earth. Contemporary issues and the societal impact of biology will be explored by learning from world-class researchers and industry experts.",

The second part involves an examination of the various forms of borrowings, including syndicated financing and project finance. The third part deals with borrowing in the capital markets (that is, without involving a bank as a lender), both domestically in Australia and in other international markets. The unit deals with Australian law and also English and European law and US tax and regulation in so far as they affect Australian companies accessing the international markets.

Students will be instructed on the fundamentals of the role of composition and structure of materials in their mechanical properties that are important for engineering design.  Students will also learn how the materials with undesirable microstructure can lead to premature failures, particularly as a result of their interaction with aggressive environment.  The knowledge thus developed will provide a basis for advanced learning on a systematic approach to materials selection as well as the methods by which the materials with the desired mechanical properties can be processed.  Case studies will be presented to highlight the importance of selecting appropriate materials for engineering design.",

Issues will be selected for examination depending on their current theoretical or practical importance. Examples include methods of constitutional interpretation (including tensions between the framers' original intentions and contemporary values); the nature of implications drawn from the Constitution; express constitutional rights (trial by jury and freedom of religion); compulsory acquisition of property; the separation of powers as source of implied rights; the \"races power\"; the defence power both in war and peace; parliamentary privilege; and the process of constitutional amendment. Other issues that acquire public prominence from time to time, such as proposals for constitutional amendment, may also be examined. Comparisons with the constitutional law of other jurisdictions will be considered where appropriate.",

Indigenous knowledge systems and systems based on western scientific tradition have often been seen as the most distant poles on a continuum that ranges from myth to science. Continuing research in Australia shows that Indigenous ecological knowledge on this continent is detailed, localised and grounded in empirical observations. In addition, Indigenous knowledge is embedded within a system of ethics that is oriented toward long-term productivity. It is usual to contrast Indigenous knowledge with non-Indigenous systems of knowledge and care in order to show their divergence or even, in many instances, their oppositions.",

Examples will be considered from both Sunni and Shi'ite perspectives across diverse landscapes. The lives and works of significant figures in modern Islamic history will be studied in order to understand the diversity of the ways in which Islamic thought has responded to the colonial and post-colonial age. The course introduces the pre-colonial background of the Mughal, Ottoman, and Safavid Empires, before moving to the colonial encounters, state reforms and emerging ideologies in the nineteenth century. The course provides an up-to-date introduction to various Muslim movements in the colonial and post-colonial period. The course materials entail selections from important primary sources, as well as audio-visual materials.",

The focus is on South Korean pop music, gaming culture and TV dramas. However, we will also be considering North and South Korean graphic novels and cinema. The course also situates the recent Hallyu (Korean Wave) phenomenon within the history of cultural flows in East Asia and we examine the processes that have contributed to the increased consumption of Korean cultural product inside and outside the Korean peninsula. One primary focus will be on the analysis of critical approaches to the understanding of North Korean state media and South Korean commercial cultural output. In particular, we analyse how state-centered promotion policies are tied up with notions of cultural nationalism. The aim is to move beyond fandom and to encourage students to situate the production of popular culture within the domestic and regional political, economic, commercial and industrial contexts and to critically analyse popular culture using a variety of methodological approaches. Each week students will be introduced to different methodological frameworks they can utilize to unpack popular culture. In their readings, they will also be exposed to a variety of approaches to the analysis of popular culture case studies.",

How did the Bolshevik ascent to power reshape the private sphere? How did the Communist authorities try to create the New Soviet Man and Woman and forge a new, Soviet national identity? What relevance do these efforts have for understanding today's post-Cold War Eastern European politics? Through literature, films, memoir, and other primary sources, students will study and analyse the impact of politics on popular culture, work, family life, education, humour, and gender relations. Readings, lectures, and tutorial discussions will explore the degree to which individuals carved out private spaces at home, at work, and in social circles to limit the impact of politics on private life. The unit will begin with a background on Russian politics and culture before the establishment of Communist governments and will end with an examination of the USSR's collapse and its aftermath. Discussions of primary sources in tutorials will provide students with the skills to analyse similar primary sources in their written work.",

Students will develop conceptual frameworks that can be applied in the range of contexts they are likely to encounter through their career. They will also be given insight into how these fundamental principles and theories contribute to the development of successful marketing strategies and tactics. Students will study the theories and implications of consumer behaviour and will gain a strong understanding of the role of the brand in delivering value to the customer and value to the organisation. These insights will help students develop an understanding of the role and value of the marketing function within an organisation. The unit will also provide students with a perspective that shows the usefulness of basic marketing conceptual models in their further study and their future careers.",

Translational researchers are involved in identifying a worthwhile scientific finding that can be applied to a clinical setting. Along this research and development pipeline are a series of critical check-points that provide the investigator vital tools to generate a valuable result that has merit for translation. This unit will establish a fundamental knowledge in the processes involved in developing a basic science finding through to clinical studies. The unit provides workshop-based learning in the development of discipline-specific laboratory research questions and how they are applied to broader clinical applications. The main focus of this unit is to identify how fundamental scientific questions may have multidisciplinary clinical answers. Other core learning outcomes are through understanding how scientific concepts can be marketed and communicated effectively through research pipeline procedures and the responsibilities of the researcher that may be derived from this.",

Learners will explore the epidemiology of the major nutrition related diseases, their causal pathways and population based recommendation for prevention. The rationale for the application of dietary modifications for patients with specific disease states and the means of evaluating dietary treatment is explored. Nutrition related emerging issues in disease aetiology and management are also explored and the emphasis on the important role of genetic susceptibility in nutrition science is continued.",

Histology studies will correlate microscopic structure with function; beginning with the cell, moving on to the four primary tissue types and following up with systems-based histology where relevant. Embryology will help in understanding human development; beginning with fertilization and following up through the development of organ-body systems, with emphasis on mechanisms regulating normal development and organisation of the body. The unit encompasses familiarisation and usage of anatomical and medical terminology. Skills in practical observation, identification and communication will be encouraged as well as the ability to source for information through the effective use of IT.",

                    "synopsis": "This unit examines the medium and its materiality across a range of visual art practices including: painting, sculpture, installation, photography, video, multi-media, social practices and performance art. It focuses on a historical lineage of art's mediums and disciplines and how they are framed, constituted and judged in a diverse range of academic fields. Concepts and traditions of modern aesthetics, the effect of late-capitalism, socio-economic critiques of art and technology are pivotal to any understanding of how art's form moves between modes of medium-specificity to trans-disciplinary realms. The unit introduces key theoretical tenets to analyse late modernist and contemporary art practices as case studies. It introduces students to the critical dialogue around the medium and artists' material processes.",

The theories of utilitarianism and deontology will be examined within the South African context and judged according to ethical dilemmas that arise within the country. Key to this examination will be a discussion of the role of friendship and family within ethical decision-making. A major focus of discussion is the opposition between consequentialist theories, such as utilitarianism, which judge rightness and wrongness solely in terms of consequences, and the Kantian theory of deontology which judges rightness and wrongness according to whether the act is in accordance with rational will. The question that will guide this discussion is whether these theories can account for the agent-centred reasons which arise from relations of love and friendship and which seem to have the potential to conflict with impartial moral requirements?",

The design studio will provide the framework for students to apply their critical understanding and creative skills to problem-based scenarios. The practice-based opportunities provided by the studio will be supplemented by complementary theoretical and design thinking content and methods. Students will be required to undertake a project that demonstrates suitable application of knowledge and techniques drawn from their identified stream of specialisation (in digital media, information and society, digital cultural heritage). Students will be expected to respond in a critical, ethical and reflective manner, while exercising creative, entrepreneurial and independent research skills. Critical discourse will be agile and responsive to contemporary issues arising at the socio-cultural interface of DH scholarship. The resulting project work will demonstrate both conceptual and technical application relevant to their knowledge domain (Arts, Information Technology, or Art Design and Architecture) to a high level of competence and literacy. The nature of the studio environment provides a unique opportunity for encouraging interdisciplinary approaches to practice and research.

It is designed to further develop, challenge and expand how students think about making artwork and to synthesise research interests, building on VPR1113. A series of individual and collaborative exercises and projects are presented to extend and further foster creative research skills and consolidate students' material skills. The main emphasis of this class is to demonstrate how thinking operates through making. Fabrication processes in the workshop can be in any medium from across two- and/or three-dimensional works, to sound and performance. The aim of these exercises is to further extend each student's capacity for production, creating a pool of ideas, strategies, forms and processes for students to draw on and develop as they progress through the course. Teaching methodology involves critical dialogue, classroom discussion and peer review. This unit presents a broad range of approaches to contemporary art and its institutions for those wishing to work in the arts industry as artists, curators, arts writers, educators or practitioners. Research Practices encourages an experimental approach to conceptual, material and public outcomes. Safe and sustainable approaches to fabrication and materials are core values in the unit.",

We study the labyrinthine palaces of the Minoans, the frescos and houses of the island culture of ancient Thera, and the rich burials and city states of Mycenaean Greece to discover what this material evidence reveals about social and economic organisation, ritual practice and thriving trade and exchange. Students are introduced to emerging techniques in archaeological research as we consider how these methods have influenced our interpretation of Minoan and Mycenaean culture. We explore the role of later Greek mythologies and epic poems, including Homer's Iliad, in shaping our interpretation of these Aegean societies and examine the reliability of their portrayal. Contemporary evidence from Egypt and the eastern Mediterranean is examined, to understand the wider world of the Minoans and Mycenaeans, alongside the study of the great city of Troy.",

This unit builds on the acquisition of dialogue interpreting and on the development and reinforcement of skills and techniques needed for consecutive interpreting. Further training in note-taking, including the use of digital pen technology, will be undertaken. Sight translation is introduced as a new skill at the beginning of this unit. In the second half of this unit, simultaneous interpreting is introduced. All four skills: dialogue, longer consecutive and simultaneous interpreting, and sight translation are used in simulated interactions. Interactional approaches to interpreting are presented as are theoretical concepts relating to health and legal interpreting as emerging research fields.",

The workshop-driven classes incorporate theoretical and historical perspectives on these gallery-based modes. This unit introduces various steps required to make art public from: studio-based processes; the engagement of critical feedback; administrative processes associated with gallery-based exhibition; installing an artwork; and contextualising the artwork in a considered theoretical and curatorial framework. The workshop program facilitates a support structure for the development and consolidation of experimental approaches to conceptual and material outcomes of burgeoning research interests. Students are required to investigate and develop individual and collaborative solutions to a series of creative public outcomes. Teaching methodology involves lectures, fieldtrips, critical dialogue, class discussion and peer review. Safe and sustainable approaches to fabrication techniques and materials are promoted as core values in the unit.",

However, the victory of market economics has not removed the state from the realm of economic decision-making. Even the most market-oriented systems exist within political frameworks that enforce contracts, resolve disputes, regulate negative externalities, and provide public goods. Furthermore, capitalism remains intensely controversial. It has created unprecedented wealth and prosperity, but has also suffered from periodic crises, and critics argue that it has exacerbated inequality and damaged the natural environment. In this unit, Monash students learn how to evaluate these competing claims. Students will be introduced to competing models of political economy, learn about key thinkers in the history of economic thought, and gain insight into the intersection between markets and political power.",

We will be especially interested in tracking formal experiments and thematic developments in this period in light of world-historical events and shifts in the relationship of writers and readers. There will be a focus on 21st century literature, with the aim of asking questions about how canons get made, movements establish themselves and interpretations become standard. Topics and themes might include: irony and sincerity; metafiction; maximalism and minimalism; 9/11 literature; the death and return of the author; the rise of creative nonfiction;; the impact of 'Theory' and Creative Writing programs on literature and criticism; book ends and book futures.",

Imagination combined with advanced conceptualisation and innovation in material manipulation should be manifest at this stage of students' practice. Students develop individual programs in conjunction with the lecturers that reflect their personal direction and evolving art practice. The program focuses on clear articulation of concepts. Lecturers facilitate students' own exploration, primarily through personal tuition where detailed analysis and discussion of students' work takes place. Whilst providing a stimulating and supportive environment this unit provides a bridge between students' experience in the supervised studio and a fully-fledged independent professional practice in the broader arts arena. The work produced culminates in an end of year exhibition of a professional standard, preparing students for entry into the professional world as fine artists in the discipline of choice, or the pursuit of further studies at a higher level.",

The art of humour, wit, metaphor and abstraction will be utilised in the answering of each brief in order to strengthen the students' illustration and intellectual skills and consequently their confidence as strong conceptual visual communicators. They will be encouraged toward experimentation and exploration of both traditional and digital illustrative techniques.",

From a macro perspective the unit provides an overview of the political, legal, social, economics and technological contexts in which business operates, the role of the states and its relationship to business and society. The unit also provides a brief look at the international environment in which business operates including cross cultural issues that may affect business operations. Continuing the understanding of the macro environment the unit considers the competitive and regulatory environment in which business operates and this is followed by a consideration of the changing global financial situation and its impact on markets and risk management. Along with the strategic economic and legal environment of business at the global, market and organisational levels, this unit will focus on the impact of new and emerging technology on business outcomes.",
